# University Week Calendar Event Creator

Every uni semester i manually make a new calendar event for each week,
this program replaces that.

It produces a csv compatible with [google calendar import](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37118) methods.

Input dates are in the format eg "Monday 16 February 2026", as is consistent with the UTS [academic calendar](https://www.uts.edu.au/for-students/current-students/managing-your-course/important-dates/academic-year-dates/2026-academic-year-dates)
